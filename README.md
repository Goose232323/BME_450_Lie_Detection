Our Snake Project

Matthew Williams, Sujesh Kurumbail, Simon Hasik

This repository will contain data and a machine learning algorithm designed to distinguish between people who are lying and people who are telling the truth using image classification. 
Trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, our model leverages deep learning techniques to analyze facial expression images and provide accurate predictions. 
Accurate lie detection is important because it helps ensure truthfulness in critical situations like criminal investigations, national security, and job screenings. 
By identifying deception, it supports justice, safety, and trust in both professional and personal contexts.
