# BME_450_Sports_Image_Classification


Matthew Williams, Sujesh Kurumbail, Simon Hasik

This repository will contain data and a machine learning algorithm designed to 
sort images into one of 100 different sports based on what is depicted in the image

Trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, our model leverages deep learning techniques 
to analyze key features within the images and provide accurate predictions. Automation 
of a task like this will allow multi-spot organizations to quickly sort a large 
repository of images. These can then be posted more easily on their website or on social
media. Image classification can also be used as a tool for social media sites to 
recommend content to their users based on what they tend to interact with.
