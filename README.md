# BME_450_Snakes


Our Snake Project

Matthew Williams, Sujesh Kurumbail

This repository will contain data and a machine learning algorithm designed to distinguish between poisonous and non-poisonous snakes using image classification. 
Trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, our model leverages deep learning techniques to analyze snake images and provide accurate predictions. 
Whether for wildlife research, safety, or educational purposes, this tool aims to assist in identifying potentially dangerous snakes with ease.
In the future this algorithm could be used in an app on your phone so that anyone could quickly identify a snake as dangerous or not.
